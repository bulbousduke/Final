<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Kymani Scott and i'de like to let you know some things about me. I've played **soccer** my whole life have a family of four me my sister my dad and my mom my  dad is actually a programmer. I aspire to be like him to my mom's a nurse and my sister is also attending **Mizzou** hoping to become a programer. I've lived here in *Columbia* my whole life as well.I used to live in *Jefferson City* I moved  to *Columbia* when I was in second grade we came here because both my parents found better job opportunities.</p>


<p>I'm very glad with this decision because  is a lot more to do here in *Columbia* then there is to do in *Jefferson City*. the only time I be going down there  is for soccer practice that's the one thing *Jefferson City* has on *Columbia* the soccer teams there are pretty good. Though *Columbia* does have a lot of good talented players,  even more than *Jefferson City* the teams here are ran by pretty bad coaches. My favorite soccer team is <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/">Arsenal</a>, clear my favorite because when I was a kid I saw the soccer commercial  which animated all the Premier League teams logos and I saw Arsenal's Cannon and thought it was the coolest thing ever. </p>

  <h3>Job Life</h3>
<p>Right now I work at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JamJerkHut/">Jamaican Jerk Hut</a> my dad's authentic Jamaican food restaurant. I've been working there for about 2 years now my one and only job it's pretty good. overall it's just super chill And fun to a certain extent when a bunch of people walk in at once it can be a bit overwhelming. As long as you got an all the tasks done for the day and Saturday ra customer up front you can just relax.</p>
